        Hi, I'm Juan Rolon (you can call me John).
        <br />
        From a young age I was very enthusiastic about things and how they
        worked. In highschool I found myself playing with things such as 3D
        printers and CNC machines (my school had them). Soon I started
        developing my own projects in Arduino (c++). In the end I realized that
        programming was the best part about it (Troubleshooting code is far
        better than troubleshooting electronics, by a longshot).
        <br />
        Aside from code, I also enjoy simple things such as working out, go to
        the gym and pump some iron (I love it).
